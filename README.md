# apwebchat-vue

A simple web chat client for the [Archipelago](https://archipelago.gg) multiworld randomizer platform.

## Using

No current host for this, so you'll need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and build it yourself:

```sh
npm install
npm run build
# this is the part where you take what's in dist/ and deploy it to a webserver or static site host.
# otherwise, you can do this to host it locally:
cd dist
npx http-server
```
